# Calculator
Basic calculator using python

This Python script allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations. It prompts the user to input two numbers and an operator (such as +, -, *, /, or **). Based on the chosen operator, the program performs the corresponding operation and displays the result.

Hereâ€™s how the program works:

The user enters the first number (x).
The program displays a list of available operators: * for multiplication, / for division, + for addition, - for subtraction, and ** for exponentiation.
The user selects an operator by entering the corresponding symbol.
The user enters the second number (y).
The program performs the operation and prints the result.
